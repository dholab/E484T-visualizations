Note to those who download this repo as a whole. This directory contains two files:
1) A text file called `strains_global.txt`, which is an _output_ of the workflow. It is included here to document the GISAID strains used to make our Supplementary Figure 2.
2) A TSV file from UShER, which contains the closest GISAID relatives to the immunocompromised individual's virus. This is an _input_ to the workflow.
