Note to those who download this repo as a whole. This directory contains two files:
1) A text file called `strains_global.txt`, which is an _output_ of the workflow. It is included here to document the GISAID strains used to make our Supplementary Figure 2.
2) A TSV file from UShER, which contains the closest GISAID relatives to the immunocompromised individual's virus. This is an _input_ to the workflow.

Tarball repositories of 1) A FASTA of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the GISAID database, and 2) The metadata associated with those sequences are required to reproduce the analyses behind our supplementary figure 2. These items can be downloaded with an account at [https://www.gisaid.org/](https://www.gisaid.org/) in the _Downloads_ menu. If you don't see these options (as we didn't), please reach out to GISAID support, or email us at nrminor@wisc.edu for the tarballs we used.
